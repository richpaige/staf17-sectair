\section{Execution}
\label{sec:execution}

SECT-AIR is a project jointly funded by the industry partners and the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) via Innovate UK, the UK's innovation agency. As a result, the project's operation is overseen by both a project management team (led by Rolls-Royce) and an Innovate UK Program Manager, who monitors and assesses progress against key performance indicators, technical plans and financial plans. The project's overall execution is guided by the following key principles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Developing an industry-led aerospace sector wide strategy for software engineering;
\item Exploiting technology used in other domains (e.g., high performance computing, multi- and many-core) in the aerospace domain;
\item Validating research results using robust industrial aerospace case studies from project partners;
\item Aligning industry development needs with academic research;
\item Delivering mature technologies and processes at a high technical readiness level;
\item Engaging with certification authorities, so as to be sure that the technologies and solutions produced will lead to systems that can realistically achieve certification. To support this, SECT-AIR will engage with the Civil Aviation Authority.
\end{itemize}
The overriding focus in all of the research activities  (carried out in the work packages, described in the next section) of SECT-AIR is on automation as a means to improve productivity. Success measures in the case studies will be based on increases in automation in different processes.
