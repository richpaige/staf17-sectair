\begin{abstract}
Software is critical to the majority of functionality in avionics and aerospace systems. The amount of safety-related software in avionics is growing rapidly (doubling in size around every four years), and the costs of software programmes in industry are increasingly unaffordable -- safety-related code can cost upwards of USD \$150 per line. At the same time, demands from avionics customers for increased scope and new functionality is increasing, and quality is non-negotiable: it is fixed by standards and safety requirements. The SECT-AIR project is addressing these cost and demand issues by focusing on automation in software engineering, with particular emphasis on model-based development
